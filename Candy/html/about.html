	<h1> OUR STORY</h1>
	<p class="para">Today I am going to tell you what me and my family call the “Candy Shop Story.”  So, this story takes place at a mall on April 8th,1985. It was my birthday and my all time favorite place to go as a kid was the Colorado Mills mall. For my birthday my parents took me we spent basically all day there, just shopping around just for me. Now that does sound like I  am a complete brat, but it was my birthday so of course the day was for me. I remember that I was so satisfied with hermit crabs  that i was begging my mom to let me get one, specifically  the one with the minnie mouse logo painted on its shell. However my mom wouldn’t let me get one probably  because i had already killed two goldfish before then. I do want to point out that growing…show more content…
So 1 hour went by and I was trying my best to stay quiet.  It had been 1 hour but to me it felt like an eternity. But i tried my best to stay focused on my mom but my eye was drawn to a sparkly sign that read “Candy Factory.”</p>
	<p class="para2"> The sign caught my eye in a heartbeat, so I wandered off to the candy store. My parents say they didn't notice. For about 5 minutes, that is till my mom realized i wasn't behind her. The candy store i was at was only about 4 stores down,so when my mom was yelling my name trying to find me I could hear her but i was too mesmerized with all the candy. My mom was calling my name and the employee of the shop  heard and she kindly went over to me and said 
	</p>
	<p class="para3">“Sweetie do have an guardian with you?” and I completely ignored her. She then said “Is that your mom calling you?” and once again I ignored her. That is when I did something completely shocking.
	</p>
